This repository contains two distinct challenges: the "Ticket Breakdown" challenge and the "Refactoring" challenge. Although these challenges are separate, they should both be completed within the same folder. Once finished, please share the link to your completed project on Coderbyte. Any written responses should be documented in markdown files within this directory.

## Ticket Breakdown Challenge
The Ticket Breakdown challenge involves breaking down a larger story into smaller, manageable tickets. This process aids in estimating story points and effort required for implementation.

For detailed instructions, refer to [Ticket_Breakdown.md](Ticket_Breakdown.md).

## Refactoring Challenge
Refactoring is a crucial step in ensuring code maintainability and modularity. It involves optimizing existing code to ensure each component performs its designated task efficiently.

For detailed instructions, refer to [Refactoring.md](Refactoring.md).

If you are new to JavaScript, follow these steps to get started:

2. Run `npm i` in this repository to install dependencies.
3. Execute `npm test` to run automated tests.
4. Launch `index.js` for manual testing by running `npm start`.
